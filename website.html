            <h2>What is a Manga???</h2>
            <p>
                Manga refers to a style of comic or graphic novel that originates from Japan. 
                The term "manga" is Japanese for "comics" or "whimsical drawings." Manga typically features stylized artwork and a wide range of genres, appealing to various age groups and tastes. 
                Itâ€™s a popular form of entertainment in Japan and has also gained significant international recognition.  
            </p>
            <h3>Key Features of Manga</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Visual Style</b>
                    <P>
                        Manga is usually drawn in black and white, 
                        although some special editions or specific chapters 
                        may be colored.
                        <p>
                            The art style can vary widely between series, from detailed, 
                            realistic drawings to more simplistic 
                            or abstract styles.

                        </p>

                    </P>
                </li>
                <li><b>Reading Format</b>
                    <p>
                        Traditionally, manga is read from right to left, which is opposite to Western comic books.
                         This applies both to the direction in which panels are arranged
                         and the way the text is read within speech bubbles.
                         <p>
                            Manga is often serialized in weekly 
                            or monthly magazines and later collected
                             into volumes called <b><i>"tankobon"</i></b>
                         </p>
                    </p>
                </li>
             <li><b>Genres and Audience</b></li>
                <p>Manga covers a vast range of genres, such as action, adventure, romance, fantasy, horror,
                 science fiction, slice-of-life, and more.
                 <p>

                 </p>
                 There are specific categories based on the target demographic:
                 <b>Shonen</b>: Targeted at young boys (e.g., "Naruto," "Dragon Ball").
                 <b>Shojo</b>: Targeted at young girls (e.g., "Sailor Moon," "Fruits Basket").
                 <b>Seinen</b>: Targeted at adult men (e.g., "Berserk," "Tokyo Ghoul").
                 <b>Josei</b>: Targeted at adult women (e.g., "Nana," "Paradise Kiss").
                 <b> Kodomo</b>: Targeted at young children (e.g., "Doraemon").
                 
                </p>
            <li><b>Volumes and Serializations</b> </li>
                <p>Many manga are serialized in magazines (like Shonen Jump), where chapters are published weekly or monthly. If a series is popular, it may continue for years.
                   <p> Once several chapters are serialized, they are collected and published in tankobon volumes, which are sold in bookstores.
                </p>
                   </p>
            <li><b>Cultural Significance</b></li>
            <p>Manga is an integral part of Japanese culture and has a rich history 
                dating back to ancient times, though modern manga 
                started gaining its current form in the mid-20th century.</p>
            <p>
                It has inspired other forms of media like anime (Japanese animation), 
                live-action movies, and video games.  
            </p>
